I am a Research Fellow in the [EzPC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/ezpc-easy-secure-multi-party-computation/) team at Microsoft Research, and work with [Dr.Rahul Sharma](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/rahsha/), [Dr. Divya Gupta](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/digup/) and [Dr.Nishanth Chandran](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/nichandr/) on Secure Multi-party Computation. My interests broadly include Systems, Security, Networks and Computer Architecture.

Previously I completed my Bachelors (B.Tech) in Computer Science from IIIT Delhi in 2023 where I worked under [Dr.Mukulika Maity](https://iiitd.ac.in/mukulika) and [Dr.Arani Bhattacharya](https://iiitd.ac.in/arani) in the Network Research Lab on my thesis project titled NATIVE: Network Aggregation based Tiled Live Video Streaming. Further I have also extensively worked with [Dr.Sambuddho Chakravarty](https://iiitd.ac.in/sambuddho) on VPNs (Virtual Private Network) fingerprintability and security in the Cryptography & Network Security Lab. In addition, in the Computer Architecture domain, I have worked on projects for Designing a Network on chip (NOC) simulator and FPGA based 100 Gigabits/sec Network cards.
